This project focuses on understanding machine learning concepts, data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, model training, and evaluating results found using Python. It uses the following datasets: **Titanic** (on Kaggle), **Diabetes** (on Kaggle) and the **Breast Cancer Wisconsion** dataset (on Scikit Learn).
</br>To understand the results of this project, you need to run the code ordered by Tasks (1 to 5). Task 1 to 4 are Jupyter notebooks and Task 5 is a Python script.
